CS3443: Simulating 4-bit MIPS ALU 

You are to write a gate level simulator for a simple 4-bit ALU
with the following operations:
AND, OR, ADD (1-bit full adder), SUB, SLT, Overflows/Zero Detection.
All the operations and architectures to simulate are based on
what we have studied in class. So, well review them before simulation.
Note that the underlying number system is two's complement.

You may use any language of your favor to write the simulator.

1) Input format (to be input from the command line):

Opcode (in string) operand1 operand2 (both operands in integer):
e.g., ADD 1111 0001, SUB 1111 0001, AND 1111 0001, OR 1111 0001, SLT 1111 0001

2) Output format (to be displayed on the screen):

-For ADD, SUB, AND, OR:
Opcode: 4-bit result, 1-bit overflow-detection, 1-bit zero-detection

ADD: 0000, 1, 1
SUB: 1110, 0, 0
AND: 0001, 0, 0
OR:  1111, 0, 0

-For SLT:
1-bit result (0 or 1)

SLT: 0001
