
CS3443 Assignment


This assignment is to implement IEEE 754.
1) Take a decimal value operand and convert it into Encode each operand into IEEE 754 format.
2) Perform an addition.
3) Perform a multiplication.

The language is not restrictd as long as one of the compilers on CSX,
e.g., C, C++, or Java. In other words, your simulator should be compilable 
and executable on CSX.
The size to simulate 32 bit.


Sample1:

Input: command line input as below,

Enter operand1 (decimal): 2345.125
Enter operand2 (decimal): .75
Enter operator (add or mult): add

(Note that the inputs are to be entered as a string)

Output: standard output on screen as below,

operand1: 0     10001010    00100101001001000000000
operand2: 0     01111110    10000000000000000000000

sum:      0     10001010    00100101001111000000000


Sample2:

Input: command line input as below,

Enter operand1 (decimal): -18
Enter operand2 (decimal): 9.5
Enter operator (add or mult): mult

(Note that the inputs are to be entered as a string)

Output: standard output on screen as below,

operand1: 1     10000011    00100000000000000000000
operand2: 0     10000010    00110000000000000000000

product:  1     10000110    01010101100000000000000
