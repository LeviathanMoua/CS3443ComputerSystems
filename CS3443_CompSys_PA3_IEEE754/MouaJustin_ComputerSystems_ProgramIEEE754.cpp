Description  :
			CS3443 Assignment


			This assignment is to implement IEEE 754.
			1) Take a decimal value operand and convert it into Encode each operand into IEEE 754 format.
			2) Perform an addition.
			3) Perform a multiplication.

			The language is not restrictd as long as one of the compilers on CSX,
			e.g., C, C++, or Java. In other words, your simulator should be compilable
			and executable on CSX.
			The size to simulate 32 bit.


			Sample 1:

			Input: command line input as below,

			Enter operand1 (decimal): 2345.125
			Enter operand2 (decimal): .75
			Enter operator (add or mult): add

			(Note that the inputs are to be entered as a string)

			Output: standard output on screen as below,

			operand1: 0     10001010    00100101001001000000000
			operand2: 0     01111110    10000000000000000000000

			sum:      0     10001010    00100101001111000000000


			Sample2:

			Input: command line input as below,

			Enter operand1 (decimal): -18
			Enter operand2 (decimal): 9.5
			Enter operator (add or mult): mult

			(Note that the inputs are to be entered as a string)

			Output: standard output on screen as below,

			operand1: 1     10000011    00100000000000000000000
			operand2: 0     10000010    00110000000000000000000

			product:  1     10000110    01010101100000000000000
